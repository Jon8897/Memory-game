# Milestone-project

In this project as you can see is my Memory game, I want to show future users an easier and more simple
way to get to improve there memory, This is a more creative way to improve your memory.

## UX
For Future Users:

* I would like for it to be easily used and accessible on all platforms.

* I would like to see a more casual gaming enviorment.

* More features to be add such as levels and different types of categories.

* I would like for everyone to enjoy a more simple way of training there memory.

* I would like to also add a more competieve enviroment for people to play against each other.

## Features

This is to make playing a game like this so easy as it requires just your phone and access to 
internet and you can just play with out having to sign up for anything.

### Existing Features

* Game page - This allows user to be able to play and see the game on the frontend.

* Menu options of type of game - This allows users to pick type of game mode and images theyd like to use.

* JavaScript - This was used to make sure the game could run smoothly with no errors and bugs.

### Features Left to Implement
Another feature I would like to use is a competieve game where you can challenge each other to who has the better memory.

## Technologies Used

* HTML-
   * The basic html layout was created to make playing the game as simple as possible.

   * JavaScript was used to be able to function and randomise the game at a new start.

* CSS-
   * CSS lay out was from different projects combined into one.

* Images-
    * The images used were taken from wikipedia.

## Testing
